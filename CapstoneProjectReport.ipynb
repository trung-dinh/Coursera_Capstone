    "### This project is an attempt to use data science tools to help find a place to open a coffee shop in the Downtown of Toronto. Finding a right place to open a venue is very important for a businessman. For a coffee  shop, it is essential that it is close to many places such as restaurants to be attractive to more customers, thus to ensure that it is profitable. Our job will be to recommend such a neighborhood in Downtown of Toronto to open a coffee shop. ###"
